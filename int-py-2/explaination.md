A decision tree is built to predict diabetes for women in the PIMA Indians dataset based on predictor variables such as number of pregnancies, insulin, bmi, age, glucose, bp, and pedigree. A subset of the PIMA Indians data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is a built-in dataset in the MASS library. The PIMA data in MASS contains 768 complete records from the original dataset. These 768 records have been broken down into two splits: Training data has 70% and Testing data has 30% of total data records. All records with zeros that donâ€™t make sense have been cleaned out of these datasets.

A decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents feature (or attribute), the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome. The topmost node in a decision tree is known as the root node. It learns to partition on the basis of the attribute value. It partitions the tree in recursively manner call recursive partitioning. This flowchart-like structure helps in decision making. Itâ€™s visualization like a flowchart diagram which easily mimics the human level thinking. That is why decision trees are easy to understand and interpret.
